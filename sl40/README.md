# penholder SL40

3D printed case for the [SL40 rev 1](https://github.com/worldspawn00/SL40), layout by SithLord#5712 and PCB designed by Worldspawn. Features a real ghetto pen holder (or raisin holder) measuring about 6mm deep and 140mm (exact measurements will vary depending on print settings). Integrated plate with a bottom that screws into brass heat set inserts in the top portion of case. Download F360 file [here](https://a360.co/39QwXY6)

Heavily inspired by this beautiful hotswap handwire build by u/Easy_Spinach [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/f4825u/update_hotswap_handwire/)

## pls read this if you for whatever reason decide to print this

The case in its current iteration uses 5 M3 screws (2x 16mm, 3x 6mm) and 5 M3 x 3mm heat-set inserts (specific ones I purchased here: [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IYWTCWW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)).

**Important note about USB port clearance.** I purchased the PCB with millmax sockets already soldered to the board. This makes the PCB sit ever so slightly farther "down" from the plate since the switches can never quite sit flush with the PCB. I made the cutout much taller than it needs to be to accomodate for a non-millmax setup where the PCB and therefore the USB port sits higher up, but unfortunately I don't have another PCB to verify clearance - so please 1. hotswap your pro micro/elite-c, and 2. IF NECESSARY may need to adjust the height at which the socketed controller sits relative to the PCB.

**Another note about me being a really bad designer** The bottom three screw holes currently sit 2-3mm away from the edge of the case. So you get these ugly distortions on both the top and bottom pieces of the case:

I'm kind of done reprinting this though, sorry

**Also screws** maybe one day I'll get to changing the design to use 3d printed threads instead of inserts, because we don't all just have random inserts lying around. unfortunately, today is not that day.
